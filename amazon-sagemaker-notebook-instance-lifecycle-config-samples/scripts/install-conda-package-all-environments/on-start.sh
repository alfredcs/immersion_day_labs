# OVERVIEW
# This script installs a single conda package in all SageMaker conda environments, apart from the JupyterSystemEnv
# which is a system environment reserved for Jupyter.

# NOTE: if the total runtime of this script exceeds 5 minutes, the Notebook Instance will fail to start up.  If you
# would like to run this script in the background, then replace "sudo" with "nohup sudo -b".  This will allow the
# Notebook Instance to start up while the installation happens in the background.
