## SageMaker Feature Store Champions Workshop - Module 4

### Leveraging the online feature store

* Get record from the online feature store during single inference.
* Use a feature set to retrieve features from multiple online feature groups in a single call from the endpoint.
* Use a SageMaker Inference Pipeline to allow feature retrieval to be clearly separated from model inference.
